The Savirix visual identity is anchored by a deep indigo primary and fresh supporting neutrals. Use the hex values below across marketing collateral, product UI themes, and documentation.

| Usage | Hex | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | `#1C2667` | Savirix Indigo — use for call-to-action buttons, links, and key illustrations. |
| Accent | `#4F8FF7` | Savirix Sky — use for hover states, charts, and highlights. |

| Warning | `#F1A936` | Savirix Amber — use for warnings that require user attention. |

| Background | `#F5F7FB` | Savirix Mist — default background for marketing sections and dashboards. |
| Text | `#1A1C1E` | Savirix Graphite — body text colour to maintain optimal contrast on light backgrounds. |

Always ensure accessible colour contrast (WCAG AA or higher) when combining these swatches. Pair the primary indigo with white (`#FFFFFF`) for maximum legibility on buttons and hero sections.
