# Apex27 overview

Apex27 is a UK-focused lettings and sales CRM aimed at negotiators, property managers and administrators. The ScribeHow walkthroughs highlight a cloud dashboard with modules for properties, contacts, viewings, offers, marketing feeds and admin controls that mirror day-to-day estate agency workflows.

## Core modules
- **Dashboard** – KPI cards for stock, applicants and tasks, recent activity feed, quick actions and timeline widgets for viewings and offers.
- **Properties** – list, filter and edit property records with rich media galleries, marketing status flags and portal feed controls.
- **Viewings & calendar** – calendar-style view of upcoming appointments, creation forms with applicant/property linking and shared calendar availability toggles.
- **Contacts/CRM** – applicant/landlord/vendor records with communication log, preferences and linked offers or tenancies.
- **Offers & tenancies** – capture offer amounts, stages and outcomes with links to properties and applicants; tenancy/letting progress visible from contact records.
- **Marketing** – portal/advertising toggles, brochure/media uploads and status indicators for live marketing.
- **Admin & settings** – company branding, user roles, calendar integration, portal options and organisation defaults.

## UX patterns
- **Navigation:** left-hand sidebar with primary modules; breadcrumbs and top action bar for context. Tabs separate sections within a record (details, marketing, activity, documents).
- **Layout:** two-column forms with labelled fields, inline validation, and sticky action buttons (Save/Publish). Cards and tables provide compact summaries with status pills and badges (e.g., Confirmed viewing, New applicant, Awaiting approval).
- **Widgets:** KPI tiles, timeline/activity feed, quick action tiles, filter bars above tables, gallery sliders for images, and collapsible side panels for secondary actions.
- **Responsiveness:** content uses stacked cards and scrollable tables suited to laptop resolutions; hover tooltips and inline icons surface extra context without leaving the page.

## What Apex27 is clearly optimised for vs Savarix goals
- **Speed for negotiators:** quick actions on the dashboard (schedule viewing, add applicant, log offer) reduce clicks compared to multi-page flows in Savarix.
- **Calendar-driven workflow:** viewing creation is tightly integrated with calendar availability and status updates, whereas Savarix currently treats viewings more like standalone events.
- **Property marketing control:** image gallery management, portal toggles and feature tags are surfaced in a single edit screen; Savarix spreads these controls across multiple tabs.
- **Contact-centric deal view:** offers and tenancies are visible directly from contact pages, helping agents stay in one place. Savarix requires more navigation between contacts, properties and deals.
